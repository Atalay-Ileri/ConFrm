Before starting, Make sure that mkfs and fscq binaries for both dfscq 
and sfscq are in fs/ 
folder.

for dfscq, binaries need to be named "dmkfs" and "sfscq"
for sfscq, binaries need to be named "smkfs" and "dfscq"

If sfscq fails to compile with 'ambiguous type from Prelude.succ' error, 
open codegen/AsyncFS.hs and replace each instance of "(Prelude.succ 
inum)" with "((Prelude.succ inum)::Prelude.Integer)", then rerun 
make (without running make clean).

To compile the tests, run
./compile-sources

To run the tests
./run-all.sh <num-of-iterations>
FUSE will complain a little but it runs so no worries.

To calculate means and standard deviation of the results, run
python process-results.py
python process-results-largefile.py
