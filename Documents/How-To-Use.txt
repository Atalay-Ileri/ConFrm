# Implementation Framework

- Operation (Developer defined)
    
    Summary:
        Defines core operations of a language.

    Definitions
        * state
        * oracle
        * operations
        * execution semantics
        * WP/SP and WCP/SCP
        * after_crash relation

    Proofs
        * WP/SP and WCP/SCP completeness
        * Determinism of execution modulo oracle


- Language (Framework generated in Language.v)
    
    Requires: 
        Operation.
    
    Summary:
        Automatically adds stateful computation monad to an Operation.
        
    Definitions
        * state
        * oracle
        * programming language
        * execution semantics
        * recovery_semantics
        * WP/SP and WCP/SCP
        * after_crash relation

    Proofs
        * WP/SP and WCP/SCP completeness
        * Determinism of execution modulo oracle
        

- Horizontal Composition (Framework generated in HorizontalComposition.v)
    Requires: 
        two Operations.
    
    Summary:
        Automatically generates a combined operation via putting them in a sum monad.




# Refinement Framework

- Operation Refinement (Developer defined)
    Requires:
        a low Language and a high Operation
    
    Summary:
        relates 
        * low states to high states (refines_to_op)
        * every op-code in high operation to a low program (compile_op)
        * low oracles to high oracles (oracle_refines_to_op)
    
    Definitions:
        * a refinement relation for states
        * a refinement relation for oracles
        * a compilation function

- Refinement (Framework generated in RefinementLift.v)
    Requires:
        an Operation Refinement and a Language generated from operation refinement's high Operation
    
    Summary:
        relates 
        * low states to high states (refines_to)
        * every program in high language to a low program (compile)
        * low oracles to high oracles (oracle_refines_to)
    
    Definitions:
        * a refinement relation for states
        * a refinement relation for oracles
        * a compilation function

- Bisimulation (Framework genarated)
